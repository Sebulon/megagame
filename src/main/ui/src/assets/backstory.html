<p><em>Command Briefing/Stardate:2260/The Icarus Incident</em></p>
<p>
  When we first colonized Mars in 2132, we discovered what came to be known as The Alpha Site. A giant hovering monolith
  made from a stone-like material none of our scientists could identify. For over a century, we have tried to study the
  strange structure. It seems completely inert, and impervious to damage from our equipment. The only thing we have been
  able to discover is strange markings that seem to circle the monolith.

  Suddenly, just last year, some of the carvings on the monolith began to glow. While our scientists were initially
  intrigued, curiosity turned to fear as we could no longer detect the presence of Neptune in our solar system. That is
  not the only thing that changed however, any object that touches the monolith now disappears. Just last month, more
  carvings have begun to activate, and we have lost contact with Uranus.

  You are our last hope if we are to understand what is happening. You are the fleet consisting of the most advanced
  ships the nations of earth could muster, our hail mary. Go forth brave explorers, and find answers before doom finds
  us.
